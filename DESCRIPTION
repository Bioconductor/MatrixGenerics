Package: MatrixGenerics
Title: S4 Generic Summary Statistic Functions that Operate on Matrix-Like Objects
Description: S4 generic functions modeled after the 'matrixStats' API
    for alternative matrix implementations. Packages with alternative matrix
    implementation can depend on this package and implement the generic 
    functions that are defined here for a useful set of row and column
    summary statistics. Other package developers can import this package
    and handle a different matrix implementations without worrying
    about incompatibilities.
